# Promo Component

Your work so far has left a deep impression on Madame Jellobutter, so much so
that she even sends you on an all-expenses paid trip to an [OCaml
Hackathon](https://fun-ocaml.com/). As soon as you arrive, you make several new
friends, and you even meet MonadicFanatic1984 in person![^1] You're extremely
psyched to start applying the things you're learning during the hackathon.

## `RR` utility module

While having lunch during the hackathon, fellow attendee FunctorPunk[^2]
suggests that you create a dedicated module for your ReasonReact-related helper
functions. Add a new file `RR.re`:

<<< RR.re#initial-functions

These are all functions we used before, but now they're in one handy place and
also have documentation comments.

## Documentation comment markup language

In a couple of the documentation comments, you see square brackets (`[]`):

```text
/** Alias for [React.string] */
```

Whatever is inside the brackets gets rendered in a monospace source code font.
This is one example of the [markup
language](https://ocaml.org/manual/5.2/ocamldoc.html#ss:ocamldoc-formatting)
used inside documentation comments.

## `Promo` component

Add new file `Promo.re`:

<<< Promo.re#first-version

For now, it just shows an input that allows the user to enter a promo code.

## `React.useReducer`

Another neat trick you learn from FunctorPunk is that you can substitute
[React.useState](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/usestate-hook)
with
[React.useReducer](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/usereducer-hook)[^3]
when defining [state
variables](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory#adding-a-state-variable):

<<< Promo.re#use-reducer{3-4,9}

The advantage of this is that you can update state by passing a value instead of
a callback. To make it even nicer, we can also rename `dispatch` to `setCode`
and use function chaining inside the `onChange` callback:

<<< Promo.re#set-code{3-4,9}

## `RR.useStateValue` helper function

This state variable pattern can be made more convenient by adding a new helper
function called `RR.useStateValue`:

<<< RR.re#use-state-value

The state setup code in `Promo` then becomes very simple:

```reason
let (code, setCode) = // [!code --]
    React.useReducer((_state, newState) => newState, ""); // [!code --]
let (code, setCode) = RR.useStateValue(""); // [!code ++]
```

## Add `Promo` to `Index`

The `Promo` component isn't finished yet, but let's add it to `Index` so that we
can see how it looks as we're building it:

<<< Index.re#make{4-5}

We know that, sooner or later, we must pass `items` and `date` to `Promo`, so we
just do it now. However, this breaks the build because `Promo` doesn't yet
define those props.

## Temporarily ignore props

We can quickfix it by adding the `~items` and `~date` props to `Promo.make` and
then immediately `ignore`ing them in the body of the function:

<<< Promo.re#ignore

A more concise way to temporarily ignore props is to use the `as` keyword in the
function argument list:

```reason
[@react.component]
let make = (~items as _: list(Item.t), ~date as _: Js.Date.t) => {
```

Here we rename `~items` to `_`, effectively ignoring it, and also do the same
for `~date`. Note that this renaming only extends to the scope of the function
itself.

## `styled-ppx` package

During dinner, you meet a cool human named Dave who introduces you to
[styled-ppx](https://ocaml.org/p/styled-ppx), the package he authored to allow
writing type-safe CSS inside OCaml. Itâ€™s inspired by
[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), and also uses Emotion under the
hood.

To install `styled-ppx`, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install @emotion/css
opam install styled-ppx
```

After these commands finish, see what version of `styled-ppx` was installed by
running `opam list`:

```text{4}
...
stdune                3.15.2      Dune's unstable standard library
stringext             1.6.0       Extra string functions for OCaml
styled-ppx            0.56.0      Type-safe styled components for ReScript and Melange
time_now              v0.16.0     Reports the current time
topkg                 1.0.7       The transitory OCaml software packager
...
```

Add `"styled-ppx" {>= "0.56.0"}` to the `depends` section of your `.opam` file.
(Adjust the version based on what you see  from `ocaml list`.)

To make sure that the version of `@emotion/css` you got from npm is compatible
with the version of `styled-ppx` you got from opam, run

```bash
npm run check-npm-deps
```

You should see some output like this:

```text
Ok: opam package "reason-react.0.14.0" requires npm package: "react-dom" with constraint "^18.0.0", version installed: "18.2.0"
Ok: opam package "reason-react.0.14.0" requires npm package: "react" with constraint "^18.0.0", version installed: "18.2.0"
Ok: opam package "styled-ppx.0.56.0" requires npm package: "@emotion/css" with constraint ">=11.0.0", version installed: "11.11.2"
```

::: tip

Underneath the covers, `npm run check-npm-deps` is just running `opam exec
opam-check-npm-deps`.

:::

::: warning

The output from `npm run check-npm-deps` might not show anything for
`styled-ppx` yet, that should be fixed soon.

:::

## Add styles to `Promo`

Try adding a style to `Promo`'s `form` element:

```reason
<form
  className=[%cx {|display: flex; flex-direction: column;|}] // [!code ++]
  onSubmit={evt => evt |> React.Event.Form.preventDefault}>
```

You'll get a compilation error:

```
File "src/order-confirmation/Promo.re", line 6, characters 16-18:
6 |     className=[%cx {|display: flex; flex-direction: column;|}]
                    ^^
Error: Uninterpreted extension 'cx'.
```

`styled-ppx` is installed, but it can't be used until the `libraries` and
`preprocess/pps` stanzas of your `dune` file have been updated:

```dune
(libraries reason-react melange-fest styled-ppx.emotion)
 (preprocess
  (pps melange.ppx reason-react-ppx styled-ppx))
```

For reference:

- Add `styled-ppx.emotion` to `libraries` to enable the `Css` and `CssJs`
  modules
- Add `styled-ppx` to `preprocess/pps` to enable the `%cx` extension node

If you run `npm run serve`, you'll see that the styles are now applied.

## `Promo.Style` submodule

Although you can use the `%cx` extension node inline within your JSX, it's
usually a good idea to put all of them in a `Style` submodule within your
component module:

<<< Promo.re#style-submodule

Then update your JSX:

<<< Promo.re#updated-jsx{2,5}

Using a `Style` submodule encourages reuse of class names and tends to make your
JSX more readable.

## `styled-ppx` is type-safe

The strings we pass to the `%cx` extension must be valid CSS and each property
must have a valid value. To see this in action, change the value of the
`flex-direction` property:

```css
flex-direction: column; // [!code --]
flex-direction: col; // [!code ++]
```

You'll get this compilation error:

```text
File "src/order-confirmation/Promo.re", lines 3-4, characters 37-43:
2 | ...................
3 | .................;
4 |     flex-direction: col.
Error: Property 'flex-direction' has an invalid value: 'col'
```

Introduce some other errors to your CSS code and see what happens.

## Install `vscode-styled-ppx` extension

Now that we're writing our CSS inside our OCaml code, the CSS is no longer
highlighted. VS Code users can resolve this by simply installing Dave's
[vscode-styled-ppx
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davesnx.vscode-styled-ppx).

## Add `submittedCode` state variable

Add a new state variable named `submittedCode`:

<<< Promo.re#submitted-code{2,8,15}

A breakdown:

- The initial value of `submittedCode` is `None`, meaning the user hasn't yet
  submitted a promo code
- Pressing the `Enter` key while editing the input submits the promo code,
  setting `submittedCode` to `Some(code)`
- Editing the input cancels the submitted promo code by setting `submittedCode`
  back to `None`

## Add `discountFunction` derived variable

Add a `discountFunction` variable that derives its value from `submittedCode`
and `date`:

<<< Promo.re#discount-function

We have to use `Option.map` since `submittedCode`'s type is `option(string)`.
Also, we must stop ignoring the `date` prop in order to use its value:

```reason
[@react.component]
let make = (~items as _: list(Item.t), ~date as _: Js.Date.t) => { // [!code --]
let make = (~items as _: list(Item.t), ~date: Js.Date.t) => { // [!code ++]
```

## Render `discountFunction`

Render `discountFunction` under the `input`:

<<< Promo.re#render-discount-function

We only render `discountFunction` when it's in the error state.

We also need to add the `codeError` class name to the `Style` submodule, which
will cause promo code error messages to be rendered in red:

<<< Promo.re#code-error-class-name

## Add `discount` derived variable

Add a `discount` variable that derives its value from `discountFunction` and
`items`:

<<< Promo.re#discount

To use the value of the `items` prop, we must stop ignoring it:

```reason
[@react.component]
let make = (~items as _: list(Item.t), ~date: Js.Date.t) => { // [!code --]
let make = (~items: list(Item.t), ~date: Js.Date.t) => { // [!code ++]
```

## Render `discount`

Render `discount` under where we render `discountFunction`:

<<< Promo.re#render-discount

- When `discount` is of the form `Some(Ok(value))`, then the discount must exist
  and we show its value (with a minus sign in front to indicate that the amount
  will be subtracted from the total value).
- When `discount` is of the form `Some(Error(code))`, then an error occurred and
  we should render an error message based on the value of `code` (this is left
  as an exercise at the end of the chapter).

We also need to add `discountError` to the `Style` submodule, which will cause
the discount error to be rendered in purple:

<<< Promo.re#discount-error-class-name

## Use one switch expression

The current rendering logic is unsatisfactory. On first glance, it looks as if
`discountFunction` is rendered first, and then `discount` is rendered below it.
But in reality, only one of the derived variables is ever rendered at a time.
That suggests that we could use a single switch expression for the render logic.
It's helpful to list the four mutually-exclusive states we need to render:

| State | What to render |
| ---- | ---- |
| No promo code submitted | Nothing |
| Promo code invalid or expired | Error message, e.g. "Invalid promo code" |
| Error applying discount | Error message, e.g. "Buy at least one more burger to enjoy this promotion" |
| Discount | The value of the discount with a minus sign in front |

One way to refactor to a single switch expression is to change the input of the
switch expression to be the tuple `(discountFunction, discount)`:

<<< Promo.re#render-tuple

This works, but it's a lot of pattern matching to render just four states.

## Use a single `discount` derived variable

We cannot have better rendering logic without first refactoring the derived
variables. Replace `discountFunction` and `discount` with just a single derived
variable `discount`:

<<< Promo.re#discount-poly

Here we used three nested switch expressions to explicitly map the values from
all the inputs to the four mutually-exclusive states we want to render. The flow
of data goes like this:

1. If `submittedCode` is `None`, return `` `NoSubmittedCode``
1. If `submittedCode` is `Some(code)`, then invoke
   `Discount.getDiscountFunction(code, date)`
   1. If the result of `Discount.getDiscountFunction(code, date)` is
      `Error(error)`, then return `` `CodeError(error)``
   1. If the result of `Discount.getDiscountFunction(code, date)` is
      `Ok(discountFunction)`, then invoke `discountFunction(items)`
      1. If the result of `discountFunction(items)` is `Error(error)`, then
         return `` `DiscountError(error)``
      1. If the result of `discountFunction(items)` is `Ok(value)`, then return
         `` `Discount(value)``

Because we use polymorphic variant tags, we don't need to define a new type. If
you hover over the `discount` variable in your editor you'll see that its
inferred type is:

```reason
[> `CodeError(Discount.error)
 | `Discount(float)
 | `DiscountError([> `MissingSandwichTypes
                   | `NeedMegaBurger
                   | `NeedOneBurger
                   | `NeedTwoBurgers ])
 | `NoSubmittedCode ]
```

## Render `discount` polymorphic variant

Now change the switch expression in your render logic to take the `discount`
polymorphic variant as its only input:

<<< Promo.re#render-discount-poly

The pattern matching is now more concise and more readable, and it is still
type-safe. Try commenting out the `` `NoSubmittedCode`` branch and you'll get a
compilation error:

```text
File "src/order-confirmation/Promo.re", lines 52-68, characters 4-7:
52 | ....{switch (discount) {
53 |      //  | `NoSubmittedCode => React.null
54 |      | `Discount(discount) => discount |> Float.neg |> RR.currency
55 |      | `CodeError(error) =>
56 |        <div className=Style.codeError>
...
65 |        <div className=Style.discountError>
66 |          {RR.s("Todo: discount error message")}
67 |        </div>
68 |      }}
Error (warning 8 [partial-match]): this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
`NoSubmittedCode
```

Muy bueno! You've created a `Promo` component that can be used to submit promo
codes and see the discounts they produce, along with any errors that might
occur. You also saw how to use a polymorphic variant to streamline the render
logic in `Promo`. In the next chapter, we'll explore how to implement `Promo`
using a normal variant, and in the process, learn more about OCaml's type
system.

## Overview

- Documentation comments have a markup language
- Use `React.useReducer` to create state variables that can be set without
  callback functions
  - You should create a helper function to make this pattern more convenient to
    use
- Temporarily ignore function arguments using the `as` keyword, e.g. `~items as
  _` will cause the `~items` argument to be ignored
- The `styled-ppx` package allows you to write type-safe CSS inside your OCaml
  code
  - You must add some extra values to the `libraries` and `preprocess/pps`
    fields of your `dune` file to use `styled-ppx`
  - Write your CSS inside the `%cx` extension node
  - It's a good idea to group the class names you create using `%cx` inside a
    submodule of your component module (you can name it `Style` or something
    similar)
  - Install the `vscode-styled-ppx` VS Code extension to get syntax highlighting
    for CSS written inside `%cx`
- Run `opam exec opam-check-npm-deps` to check that your NPM dependencies are
  compatible with your Melange packages
- A good strategy for rendering mutually-exclusive states is to create a single
  switch expression that maps your inputs to each state, where each state is
  represented by a different variant tag.

## Exercises

<b>1.</b> Render the different error messages for the `` `DiscountError`` branch
of `Promo`'s switch expression. Here's what message should be shown for each
tag:

| Variant tag | Message |
| ------------------------------- | ------- |
| `` `NeedOneBurger`` | Buy at least 1 more burger to enjoy this promotion |
| `` `NeedTwoBurgers`` | Buy at least 1 more burgers to enjoy this promotion |
| `` `NeedMegaBurger`` | Buy a burger with every topping to enjoy this promotion |
| `` `MissingSandwichTypes`` | Buy every sandwich to enjoy this promotion  |

::: details Solution

<<< Promo.re#discount-error-message

<b>2.</b> Refactor the `Order` component to use `styled-ppx` and your new `RR`
helper function module.

::: details Hint

`styled-ppx` supports [nested
selectors](https://styled-ppx.vercel.app/reference/selectors).

:::

::: details Solution

After refactoring, `Order.re` might look something like this:

<<< Order.re

You should do some cleanup:

- Delete `Format` module, since it has been replaced by `RR`.
- Delete `order-item.module.css` and `order.module.css` files, since they are no
  longer used.
- Delete the `melange.emit/runtime_deps` stanza from your `dune` file, since
  there are no more `.css` files to copy into the build directory.

:::

<b>3.</b> Right now, `Item.toPrice` is a nondeterministic function---it returns
a different price for a turducken sandwich depending on the day of the week[^4].
This makes writing some discount tests more complicated than necessary, and
could cause more problems down the road. Refactor `Item.toPrice` by adding a
labeled argument `~date`, then:

- Fix the resulting compilation errors by adding `~date` arguments to functions
  higher on the call chain
- Simplify the tests that have this comment: `// Don't use hardcoded value since
  Item.toPrice is non-deterministic`
- You might break the tests in `DiscountTests.GetDiscount`, but don't worry
  about that for now. We'll fix those tests in the following exercise.

::: details Hint

Let the compilation errors guide your refactoring.

:::

::: details Hint

Feel free to make liberal use of partial application.

:::

::: details Solution

Most of the changes are fairly mechanical, consisting of adding a `~date`
argument up the function call chain until you get to `Index.App.make`.

There is at least one point of interest---you can opt to not give
`Discount.getFreeBurgers` a `~date` argument, since it only computes prices of
burgers, which don't fluctuate with time. But then you must use partial
application in `Discount.getDiscountFunction`:

<<< Discount.re#get-discount-function{7,9}

The indirect consequence of this is that tests like this fail:

<<< DiscountTests.re#test-half-promo

Comparing two partially-applied functions for strict equality will always fail,
because they are two newly-created objects. See [this playground
snippet](https://melange.re/v4.0.0/playground/?language=Reason&code=bGV0IGZvbyA9IChhLCB%2BYikgPT4gYSArIGI7CgovLyBVc2Ugc3RyaWN0IGVxdWFsaXR5ICg9PT0pIHdoZW4gY29tcGFyaW5nIGZ1bmN0aW9ucwpKcy5sb2coZm9vID09PSBmb28pOyAvLyB0cnVlCkpzLmxvZyhmb28ofmI9MSkgPT09IGZvbyh%2BYj0xKSk7IC8vIGZhbHNl&live=off)
for a concise demonstration of this.

The next exercise will explore how we can make the tests pass without adding an
extraneous `~date` argument to `Discount.getFreeBurgers`.

:::

<b>4.</b> Fix the tests in `DiscountTests.GetDiscount` that were broken by your
refactoring in the previous exercise.

::: details Hint

Make a helper function that is similar to `Discount.getDiscountFunction` but
can return something like this: ``Ok((`FreeBurgers, getFreeBurgers))``

:::

::: details Hint

Use
[Result.map](https://melange.re/v3.0.0/api/re/melange/Stdlib/Result/#val-map),
[fst](https://melange.re/v3.0.0/api/re/melange/Stdlib/#val-fst), and
[snd](https://melange.re/v3.0.0/api/re/melange/Stdlib/#val-snd).

:::

::: details Solution

Inside `Discount`, define a helper function called `getDiscountPair`,
and redefine `getDiscountFunction` using it:

<<< Discount.re#get-discount-function-pair{6,8,10}

The type signature of `getDiscountFunction` remains unchanged, returning a
function encased in `Ok` when it succeeds. In contrast, `getDiscountPair`
returns a 2-tuple encased in `Ok`:

- The first element of the tuple is a variant tag indicating which function was
  returned, e.g. `` `FreeBurger``, `` `HalfOff``, etc.
- The second element of the tuple is the discount function

The variant tag serves to give test code something to compare against:

<<< DiscountTests.re#use-discount-function-pair{2-3,20-21}

Recall that the runtime representation of a variant tag without arguments is
just a string. They can be compared using `Fest.deepEqual` without any
surprises.

Run `npm run test` to verify that all tests are passing again.
