# Melange for React Developers

::: warning

This is a work in progress.

:::

## Motivation

This is a project-based, guided introduction to Melange and its ecosystem.
Because Melange uses both OCaml and JavaScript ecosystems, there are quite a few
tools and concepts to learn. Therefore we try to make each chapter small and
digestible, not introducing too many things at once.

## Audience

You should already know how to make frontend applications in JavaScript, in
particular with [React](https://react.dev/). You should be interested in
learning how to leverage your existing knowledge to build apps using
[ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/). You do not need to know
OCaml[^1]---we'll slowly introduce the basics of the language throughout the
tutorial. That said, a good complement to this guide is [OCaml Programming:
Correct + Efficient + Beautiful](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/), which
teaches the language from the ground up and goes much deeper into its features.

## Chapters and topics

| Title  | Summary | Topics covered |
| ------ | ------- | -------------- |
| Counter | Number that can be incremented or decremented | module, Option, `React.string`, pipe last operator, function chaining, switch expression |
| Numberic Types | Use Melange Playground to explore OCaml’s numeric types | Int, Float, Playground, sharing snippets, comparison operators, arithmetic operators, widgets in Playground |
| Celsius Converter | Single input that converts from  Celsius to Fahrenheit | `Js.t` object, string concatenation (`++`), exception handling, ternary expression, if-else expression, labeled argument, partial application, `{js\|\|js}` quoted string literal |
| Celsius Converter using Option | The same component from the last chapter but replacing exception handling with Option | Option, `Option.map`, `when` guard |
| Introduction to Dune | A introduction to the Dune build system | `dune-project` file, `dune` file, `melange.emit` stanza, monorepo structure |
| Order Confirmation | An order confirmation for a restaurant website | variant type, primary type of module (`t`), wildcard (`_`) in switch, `fun` syntax, `Js.Array` functions, `React.array`, type transformation functions |
| Styling with CSS | Styling the order confirmation using CSS | `mel.raw` extension node, `runtime_deps` field, `glob_files` term, `external`, `mel.module` attribute |
| Better Sandwiches | Support different kinds of sandwiches by adding constructor arguments | variant constructor argument, variant pattern matching, `{j\|\|j}` quoted string literal, `Printf.sprintf`, building bundles |
| Better Burgers | Support different toppings for burgers by using records | record type, record destructuring, record pattern matching, submodules, wildcard |
| Sandwich Tests | Add unit tests for sandwich-related logic | opam switch, `opam switch`, `opam install`, `opam list`, `.opam` file, `melange-fest`, `open` module, `module_systems` field, punning, type inference |
| Cram Tests | Set up cram tests to run your unit tests | cram tests, `cram` stanza, Dune alias, promotion, test output sanitization, sandbox, `expand_aliases_in_sandbox` stanza |
| Burger Discounts | Implement burger discount logic using arrays | limits of type inference, type annotation of function arguments, full name (asset path), `Stdlib`, record spread syntax, `ignore`, runtime representations of common data types, properties of arrays, override `Array.get` |
| Discounts Using Lists | Re-implement burger discount logic using lists | properties of lists, pattern matching on lists, list spread syntax, `List` module, `ListLabels` module, runtime representation of lists, documentation comments, placeholder operator |

...and much more to come!

[^1]:
    Because of the focus on ReasonReact, we won't cover traditional OCaml
    syntax in this guide. Instead, we'll cover the [Reason
    syntax](https://reasonml.github.io/) which works great with ReasonReact
    because of its first-class support for JSX.
